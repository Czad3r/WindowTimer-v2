# WindowTimer-v2
It measures the time of active window, when we just use computer. We can take a look on these data on table or on bar chart.
I used wpf toolkit library for drawing bar chart.
I implemented notify icon, when app is running, window is minimalized to notify icon on system bar.
I've also added detecting user activity by checking mouse position on every tick of DispatcherTimer
